# Azure Active Directory OAuth

Forked from [Earlybyte.aad_oauth](https://github.com/Earlybyte/aad_oauth).

A Flutter OAuth package for performing user authentication against Azure Active Directory OAuth2 v2.0 endpoint. Forked from [hitherejoe.FlutterOAuth](https://github.com/hitherejoe/FlutterOAuth).

Supported Flows:
 - [Authorization code flow (including refresh token flow)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)

## Usage

For using this library you have to create an azure app at the [Azure App registration portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/). Use native app as platform type (with callback URL: https://login.live.com/oauth20_desktop.srf).

Afterwards you have to initialize the library as follow:

```dart
final Config config = Config(
        azureTennantId: "$TENANT_ID",
        clientId: "$CLIENT_ID",
        scope: "$scope",
        redirectUri: "$redirectUri",
        responseType: "$responseType");
final FlutterAadOauth oauth = FlutterAadOauth(config);
```
This allows you to pass in an tenant ID, client ID, scope and redirect url.
### Four important things:
1. ResponseType for mobile is usually "code", and web is usually "id_token + token";
2. Redirect URI to Flutter Web is explained below.
3. `nonce` is an optional parm to Web flow
4. To save multiple tokens it is necessary to pass tokenIdentifier in the FlutterAadOauth constructor. The parameter is used to define different names in storage, avoiding overwriting data.


Then once you have an OAuth instance, you can call `login()` and afterwards `getAccessToken()` or `getIdToken()` or the `getRefreshToken()` to retrieve an access token or the id token or the refresh token:

```dart
await oauth.login();
String accessToken = await oauth.getAccessToken();
String idToken = await oauth.getIdToken();
String refreshToken = await oauth.getRefreshToken();
String tokenType = await oauth.getTokenType();
DateTime issueTimeStamp = await oauth.getIssueTimeStamp();
DateTime refreshToken = await oauth.getExpireTimeStamp();
int refreshToken = await oauth.getExpiresIn();
```

You can also call `getAccessToken()` directly. It will automatically login and retrieve an access token.
You can also call `getIdToken()` directly. It will automatically login and retrieve an id token.
You can also call `getRefreshToken()` directly. It will automatically login and retrieve a refresh token.
You can also call `getTokenType()` directly. It will retrieve the token type.
You can also call `getIssueTimeStamp()` directly. It retrieve the Issue Time Stamp.
You can also call `getExpireTimeStamp()` directly. It retrieve the Expire Time Stamp.
You can also call `getExpiresIn()` directly. It retrieve the value of when the token expires in.

Tokens are stored in Keychain for iOS or Keystore for Android. To destroy the tokens you can call `logout()`:

```dart
await oauth.logout();
```

## Flutter Web

There are a few steps to make the authentication flow in Flutter Web:
1.  Your project must have a web folder at the root of the directory (Flutter 2.0);
2.  Inside this folder it is necessary to create the file `authRedirect.html`, to be the redirect page, when requesting the token. This html file needs to have a script with the post method, like this:
```HTML
<script>
    window.opener.postMessage(window.location.href, '*');
</script>
```
3. The redirect URL must be previously registered in Azure, so the application must always run on the same port. To do this just use the `--web-port=3000` flag in `flutter run`, or add the `args` to the launch.json file (VsCode) as shown below
```json
"args": ["--web-port", "3000"],
```
4. In the repository of this package, there is an example folder, with a flutter project that uses this lib with mobile and web authentication.

### Example To Get Redirect URI 
```dart
final currentUri = Uri.base;
redirectUri = Uri(
  host: currentUri.host,
  scheme: currentUri.scheme,
  port: currentUri.port,
  path: '/authRedirect.html',
);
```
